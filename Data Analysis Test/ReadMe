It was interesting to see that all the bad reviews only wanted their most basic needs to be provided by the hotels. i.e Hygiene, Food, and Sleep, and the data shows it. The learning and finding experience was great, it felt like solving real problem and if I was a hotel owner/manager I could sure have used these findings to improve my services. The test only said 5 insights but I think there is more to be found but it will take time so I am submitting the findings.
